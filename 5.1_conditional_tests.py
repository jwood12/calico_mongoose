# 5-1. 12/10/2023 Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement 
# describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your 
# code should look something like this:
car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == "subaru")

print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')

# Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line
# evaluates to True or False.
# Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 
# 4 tests evaluate to False.
